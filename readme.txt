This is young software. It works, but there's a lot left on the todo (check out the Other Notes tab). Have an idea? Let me know.

    * Possibility of a CTA message.
    * Possibility to add more numbers.
    * Possibility of adding more buttons with different functionalities.

Want to add something here? I'm all ears. plugins at [lpcode.com.br](https://lpcode.com.br/) or @[lp.code](https://instagram/lp.code) on instagram.
